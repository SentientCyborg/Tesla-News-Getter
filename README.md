# Tesla-News-Getter

This is my solution for Day 36 of the Udemy course [100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The solution
presented here takes a diffent approach than the one discussed in the lesson, but the results are the same. 

The purpose of this code is to send text messages of top headlines for Tesla if the stock price changes more than 5%.

Anyone wanting to run this code will need to provide their own API keys and phone numbers in the locations annotated in the code. 

This program was coded for educational purposes only and should not be used for investment purposes.
